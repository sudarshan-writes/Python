# 🐍 Python for Beginners – Step-by-Step Learning Series

Welcome 👋

This repository is part of my **Daily Python learning series**, where I post one Python topic every day — starting from absolute basics and moving step-by-step towards Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

If you're new to programming, don’t worry.
This series is made especially for beginners.

## Who Is This For?

This series is perfect for:

* ✅ Complete beginners with no coding background
* ✅ Students starting Python
* ✅ Anyone who wants to build strong fundamentals
* ✅ Learners preparing for interviews
* ✅ People who want to improve logic building

## What You Will Learn

We will cover Python from scratch:

### Basics of Python

* Jupyter Notebook & Identifiers
* Data Types
* Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise, etc.)
* Strings (Indexing, Slicing, Methods)
* Lists and Their Methods
* Tuples & Sets
* Dictionaries

### Flow Control & Functions

* If, Else, and Nested Conditions
* Ternary Operator
* For Loop
* While Loop
* Nested Loops
* List Comprehension
* Functions
* Types of Arguments
* Lambda Functions

* Pattern Programming

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

* Classes & Objects
* Types of Variables
* Methods
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction

## My Goal

The goal of this series is to:

* Make Python simple and easy to understand
* Help you build strong fundamentals
* Improve your problem-solving skills
* Make you confident in writing Python code

## How to Follow This Series

1. Go topic by topic (don’t rush).
2. Run the code yourself.
3. Practice daily.
4. Try modifying the examples.
5. Stay consistent — even 30 minutes daily is enough.

## Important Advice for Beginners

* It’s okay to feel confused at first.
* Mistakes are part of learning.
* Practice is more important than watching.
* Don’t compare your journey with others.

Keep going. You will improve 💪
