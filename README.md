# 🐍 Python for Beginners – Step-by-Step Learning Series

Welcome 👋

This repository is part of my **Daily Python learning series**, where I post one Python topic every day — starting from absolute basics and moving step-by-step towards Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

If you're new to programming, don’t worry.
This series is made especially for beginners.

## Who is This For?

This series is perfect for:

* ✅ Complete beginners with no coding background
* ✅ Students starting Python
* ✅ Anyone who wants to build strong fundamentals
* ✅ Learners preparing for interviews

## My Goal

The goal of this series is to:

* Make Python simple and easy to understand
* Help you build strong fundamentals
* Improve your problem-solving skills
* Make you confident in writing Python code

## How to Follow This Series

1. Go topic by topic (don’t rush).
2. Run the code yourself.
3. Practice daily.
4. Try modifying the examples.
5. Stay consistent — even 30 minutes daily is enough.

## Important Advice for Beginners

* It’s okay to feel confused at first.
* Mistakes are part of learning.
